# weather-dashboard

## Description

A simple weather application that allows a user to check the weather on searched city(with 5 day forecast) and save it to local storage. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

Code uses the Moment.js (https://momentjs.com/) library to work with date and OpenWeather API (https://openweathermap.org/) for weather data.

### User Story

GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs

WHEN I search for a city

THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history

WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city

THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index

WHEN I view the UV index

THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe

WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city

THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity

WHEN I click on a city in the search history

THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
